# CartPole DQN
Thit project is concerned with using [DQN](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf) to solve the [CartPole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) task.

## Installation
1) Create a virtual environment (venv, pipenv, conda, ...) with Python 3 (Python 3.7.4 recommended) and pip
2) Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3) Make sure you have CUDA installed (essentially any version compatible with pytorch, see below)
4) Install pytorch to match your CUDA version (project was built for pytorch 1.2, so keep this in mind when deciding what pytorch-CUDA combination to install)
